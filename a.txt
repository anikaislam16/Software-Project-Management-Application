This is my final year project. I am implementing the practices that are performed in Kanban, Scrum and Test Driven Development. 
Scrum:
Implemented Product Backlog and Sprint Board functionalities.
Users can attach files to tasks, add subtasks, assign labels, set dates, and define priorities.
Capabilities to update and delete fields are incorporated.
In progress: Developing graphical representations for better visualization and decision-making.

Kanban:

Implemented Kanban Boards with features similar to Scrum, allowing file attachments, subtasks, labels, dates, and priorities.
Users can update and delete fields.
In progress: Developing graphs for enhanced visualization and decision-making.

Test Driven Development (TDD):

Yet to be implemented. Planning and development for TDD practices are pending.
